You are helping a UX designer understand the results of a Figma-to-code export.

A new export just completed. Below is a listing of the current contents of the `data/` directory, including all subfolders and files:

{{fileTree}}

Write a clear, natural-language summary that includes:
- What types of files were found (e.g., JSON trees, images, fonts)
- What each file likely represents based on its name and folder
- Any patterns or structure you notice (e.g., multiple exports, organized folders)
- Any helpful next steps or insights the designer might care about

Respond in 2â€“4 concise paragraphs using plain, friendly language. Be thoughtful, but only base conclusions on what you can observe from the filenames and structure.
